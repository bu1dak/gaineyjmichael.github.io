														<h2>About Me</h2>
														
													</header>

													
													<p>The idea of this site is to show the knowledge that I learned at Purdue University Global. While working full time at Change Healthcare, I learned a lot about myself and what I enjoy doing. I enjoy working on a team of my peers. I like seeing how other people think, how they work, and how they manage situations. At Change Healthcare, I have been molded and learned to adapt in all sorts of situations. I learned a few years in, that work experience and education can go along with each other. I decided to apply to Purdue University Global while it was still Kaplan University. Within about four months of graduating, they announced the name change. My goal all along was to start and finish with my degree. After a few semesters, that's when my goal changed to finish with a 4.0 GPA. I knew this stuff and was really enjoying learning in the subjects that I didn't already know. I had some incredible professors that helped me along the way. Some days I wanted to just give up, but then I got into the degree courses. I learned programming with programs like Alice and started building websites from the ground up. That's when I decided this was the right path for me. I had never had so much fun learning and applying that knowledge. Along with basic troubleshooting of desktop administration, networking classes, and database classes, I feel like all of that knowledge is just wanting to get out. This website has really let me take that excitement that I had while studying, and apply it to my real life and work life. I decided to show my hobbies as well as my work experience because it shows who I am as a person.</p>
